`nifra_types` — a new MCP tool that returns the **exact TypeScript** of any exported `@nifrajs/*` symbol (interface, type, class, function, const). Each signature is generated at build time from the package's built `.d.ts` with the TS compiler — the literal declaration, complete and authoritative, never prose and never truncated — and shipped inside `@nifrajs/cli` (`docs/types.json`), so it works offline and on every transport (stdio, HTTP, the edge `/mcp`).

This closes the gap that made agents fall back to reading `.d.ts`: when an agent needs the precise shape of a type (`RateLimitStore`, `RouteSchema`, a function signature), `nifra_types({ name })` returns the literal block. The tool description makes the completeness explicit ("the source of truth — do NOT read `.d.ts`"), and `nifra_docs` now points at it for exact types. `nifra_examples_app` on the public docs MCP, and the `@nifrajs/cli/mcp` self-host surface, both expose it too (`TypeEntry` is re-exported).
