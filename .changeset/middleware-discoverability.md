Surface `@nifrajs/middleware` where agents look. The `nifra_context` conventions (and a scaffolded app's `AGENTS.md`) now carry a one-line pointer: cross-cutting concerns — rate limiting (`429`), CORS, security headers, body limits, auth, CSRF, IP restriction, caching, compression — are `app.use(...)` plugins in `@nifrajs/middleware`; call `nifra_docs("middleware")` for the full list. So an agent setting up routes finds the built-in middleware (it already shipped) without having to think to search for it.
