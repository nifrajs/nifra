### Patch Changes

- 5840c98: Two hot-path costs removed. On Bun, the socket peer address is now resolved lazily: `c.clientIp` keeps its documented raw-peer behavior, but the underlying `requestIP()` lookup (surprisingly expensive per request) only runs when something actually reads it - trust-mode routes still resolve it before the handler. On Node, buffered SSR responses no longer clone the response-header record (and every Set-Cookie array) before `writeHead` - the producer already hands over response-normalized names and values.

## 2.6.0

### Patch Changes

- e6349e5: Security hardening across input parsing and code generation. Every regex that runs on caller-influenced input (URL paths, route patterns, stylesheet and SVG sources, manifest text) is now linear - no polynomial backtracking on adversarial input. SVG preamble stripping and tag removal can no longer splice removed delimiters into new markers. Static file serving rejects `..` traversal in the request form outright and confines the resolved path with a `relative()` containment check. Generated code embeds strings through an escaper that neutralizes `</script>` breakout and the U+2028/U+2029 line separators, and HTML entity decoding resolves `&amp;` last so double-encoded entities cannot double-unescape.
- 994a944: `serve` no longer passes an explicit `undefined` hostname to `http.Server.listen`. Node accepts that overload, but Bun's Node-compatible server can misinterpret it (especially with `port: 0`) as a failed bind; omitting the argument selects the same default host with an unambiguous overload.

### Minor Changes

- a7b1d60: Add `c.clientIp` - the caller's IP, derived correctly and vendor-neutrally.

  By default it is the raw socket peer the serving adapter observed (`listen()`, `@nifrajs/node`, `@nifrajs/deno` supply it; any caller can pass it via `app.fetch(req, { clientIp })`), the one address a client cannot forge - and never a forwarded header. Behind a reverse proxy or CDN, set the `clientIp` server option to derive the real caller from the forwarding chain as far as you trust it:

  - `server({ clientIp: { trustedHops: n } })` reads `X-Forwarded-For` past `n` proxies you operate (a short header fails closed to `undefined`);
  - `server({ clientIp: { header: "x-real-ip" } })` trusts one edge-set header's first value.

  Declaring trust the app can't enforce would let clients forge their IP, so it stays unset by default. `c.clientIp` is safe to key rate limits and audit logs on, and is resolved once before handlers, `derive`, and hooks run.

### Patch Changes

- ade0c7a: Add a curated `@nifrajs/core/server` entry for the common HTTP runtime and dedicated subpaths for
  contracts, classification, cookies, logging, routing, Standard Schema, SEO, SSE, and webhooks. The
  package root remains backwards compatible, while new scaffolds and first-party runtime packages avoid
  eagerly parsing opt-in causality, invariant, manifest, reflection, capability, and assurance tooling.

### Minor Changes

- 0ac2182: perf(node): lean request source for GET/HEAD

  GET/HEAD requests (the bulk of API traffic) now use a smaller request-source object in the Node
  adapter: no body plumbing is allocated (GET/HEAD carry none, per the fetch spec - `body` is `null`,
  `boundedBody()` resolves empty), while headers and the full Web `Request` stay lazily available if
  read. Body-capable methods keep the existing lazy source. No behavior change.

### Patch Changes

- de9675b: Pre-1.0 security hardening pass. A framework-wide audit found no critical/high issues; these close the medium/low items it surfaced.

  - **`cache()` - no cross-user leak by default.** A `200` to a request bearing `Authorization`/`Cookie` is no longer stored (and replayed to other users) unless the response is explicitly `Cache-Control: public`/`s-maxage` (RFC 9111 §3.5). Opt back in per cache with `cacheAuthenticated: true` for a route that's identical for every caller.
  - **`idempotency()` - route-scoped keys + a `key` hook.** The default store key is now scoped by method+path, so the same `Idempotency-Key` on a different endpoint can't collide and replay another resource's response. Added a `key(req, header)` option to scope by principal (e.g. user id). Method matching normalized to upper-case.
  - **`etag()` - a `304` no longer carries the `200`'s `Content-Length`/`Content-Type`.**
  - **`@nifrajs/core` - inbound WebSocket frames are capped** when serving on Bun (`listen()`): frames over `wsMaxPayloadBytes` (default `maxBodyBytes`, 1 MB) are rejected by the runtime before reaching a handler, so a huge frame can't be buffered/parsed into memory. New `ServerOptions.wsMaxPayloadBytes`.
  - **`@nifrajs/core` - WebSocket routes are same-origin by default (CSWSH).** A `ws()` route with no `allowedOrigins` now rejects a **cross-origin browser** handshake (an `Origin` whose host differs from the request's) with `403` - closing cross-site WebSocket hijacking, since browsers send cookies on WS handshakes and don't apply CORS. Non-browser clients (no `Origin`) and same-origin browsers are unaffected. **Breaking** for a route that served a cross-origin browser without declaring `allowedOrigins`: set `allowedOrigins` to the permitted origins (or `() => true` for a genuinely public socket).
  - **`@nifrajs/node` - static file handler** now adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and re-checks the real path (symlink containment) before streaming, matching the image server.
  - **`@nifrajs/mcp` - widget bridge** now rejects `postMessage` events whose source isn't the parent window (including null-source synthetic events), closing a spoofing gap the previous guard left open.
  - **`@nifrajs/cli` - the MCP `nifra_run`/`nifra_ws` `entry` arg** is kept inside the project root, so a crafted `entry` can't import/execute a module outside the project.
