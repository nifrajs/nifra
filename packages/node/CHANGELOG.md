### Minor Changes

- 0ac2182: perf(node): lean request source for GET/HEAD

  GET/HEAD requests (the bulk of API traffic) now use a smaller request-source object in the Node
  adapter: no body plumbing is allocated (GET/HEAD carry none, per the fetch spec — `body` is `null`,
  `boundedBody()` resolves empty), while headers and the full Web `Request` stay lazily available if
  read. Body-capable methods keep the existing lazy source. No behavior change.

### Patch Changes

- de9675b: Pre-1.0 security hardening pass. A framework-wide audit found no critical/high issues; these close the medium/low items it surfaced.

  - **`cache()` — no cross-user leak by default.** A `200` to a request bearing `Authorization`/`Cookie` is no longer stored (and replayed to other users) unless the response is explicitly `Cache-Control: public`/`s-maxage` (RFC 9111 §3.5). Opt back in per cache with `cacheAuthenticated: true` for a route that's identical for every caller.
  - **`idempotency()` — route-scoped keys + a `key` hook.** The default store key is now scoped by method+path, so the same `Idempotency-Key` on a different endpoint can't collide and replay another resource's response. Added a `key(req, header)` option to scope by principal (e.g. user id). Method matching normalized to upper-case.
  - **`etag()` — a `304` no longer carries the `200`'s `Content-Length`/`Content-Type`.**
  - **`@nifrajs/core` — inbound WebSocket frames are capped** when serving on Bun (`listen()`): frames over `wsMaxPayloadBytes` (default `maxBodyBytes`, 1 MB) are rejected by the runtime before reaching a handler, so a huge frame can't be buffered/parsed into memory. New `ServerOptions.wsMaxPayloadBytes`.
  - **`@nifrajs/core` — WebSocket routes are same-origin by default (CSWSH).** A `ws()` route with no `allowedOrigins` now rejects a **cross-origin browser** handshake (an `Origin` whose host differs from the request's) with `403` — closing cross-site WebSocket hijacking, since browsers send cookies on WS handshakes and don't apply CORS. Non-browser clients (no `Origin`) and same-origin browsers are unaffected. **Breaking** for a route that served a cross-origin browser without declaring `allowedOrigins`: set `allowedOrigins` to the permitted origins (or `() => true` for a genuinely public socket).
  - **`@nifrajs/node` — static file handler** now adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and re-checks the real path (symlink containment) before streaming, matching the image server.
  - **`@nifrajs/mcp` — widget bridge** now rejects `postMessage` events whose source isn't the parent window (including null-source synthetic events), closing a spoofing gap the previous guard left open.
  - **`@nifrajs/cli` — the MCP `nifra_run`/`nifra_ws` `entry` arg** is kept inside the project root, so a crafted `entry` can't import/execute a module outside the project.
