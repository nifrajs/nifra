### Minor Changes

- a7b1d60: Add `c.clientIp` - the caller's IP, derived correctly and vendor-neutrally.

  By default it is the raw socket peer the serving adapter observed (`listen()`, `@nifrajs/node`, `@nifrajs/deno` supply it; any caller can pass it via `app.fetch(req, { clientIp })`), the one address a client cannot forge - and never a forwarded header. Behind a reverse proxy or CDN, set the `clientIp` server option to derive the real caller from the forwarding chain as far as you trust it:

  - `server({ clientIp: { trustedHops: n } })` reads `X-Forwarded-For` past `n` proxies you operate (a short header fails closed to `undefined`);
  - `server({ clientIp: { header: "x-real-ip" } })` trusts one edge-set header's first value.

  Declaring trust the app can't enforce would let clients forge their IP, so it stays unset by default. `c.clientIp` is safe to key rate limits and audit logs on, and is resolved once before handlers, `derive`, and hooks run.

### Patch Changes

- ade0c7a: Add a curated `@nifrajs/core/server` entry for the common HTTP runtime and dedicated subpaths for
  contracts, classification, cookies, logging, routing, Standard Schema, SEO, SSE, and webhooks. The
  package root remains backwards compatible, while new scaffolds and first-party runtime packages avoid
  eagerly parsing opt-in causality, invariant, manifest, reflection, capability, and assurance tooling.
