### Patch Changes

- 5018546: fix(web): built apps now ship their CSS link. `buildServer`/`generateServerManifest` bake the client build's
  stylesheet URLs (`BuildManifest.css` + `routeStyles`) into the server manifest, and the generated server entry
  passes them to `createWebApp` — which already emits `<link rel="stylesheet">` in the SSR `<head>`. Previously the
  head carried the JS modulepreload but no stylesheet, so every built (non-dev) app rendered unstyled. `styles`
  and `routeStyles` are now always exported from the generated manifest (default empty), so hand-written server
  entries can `import { styles, routeStyles } from "./server-manifest"` and forward them too.
