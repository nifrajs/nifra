# @nifrajs/mcp

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- c099d5f: Add `@nifrajs/mcp` — build MCP servers, and **MCP Apps** (interactive `ui://` widgets, SEP-1865), for a nifra app.

  MCP tools have only ever returned text. MCP Apps lets a tool return **interactive UI**: a tool links a `ui://` resource (MIME `text/html;profile=mcp-app`); the host renders it in a sandboxed iframe and bridges it to the server over MCP-JSON-RPC-on-`postMessage`. `@nifrajs/mcp` ships:

  - The transport-agnostic JSON-RPC core (`handleRpc`, shared with `@nifrajs/cli`'s dev MCP) extended for MCP Apps — `structuredContent`, `_meta.ui.resourceUri`, and the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` capability.
  - `respondMcpHttp` — a Web `fetch` handler you mount at `POST /mcp`. nifra route handlers can return a raw `Response`, so mounting is one line per verb.
  - `defineMcpWidget` — author a `ui://` widget as one self-contained HTML doc with a tiny zero-dependency `postMessage` bridge inlined (`mcpApp.onData(render)` to render the host-pushed `structuredContent`; `mcpApp.callTool(...)` to re-invoke a tool through the host).
  - `defineMcpTool` + `createMcpServer` — wire tools to widgets and get a mountable server. See `examples/mcp-app/`.
  - `@nifrajs/mcp/react` — `reactWidget({ component })` authors a widget from a React component instead of an HTML string: the component is bundled for the browser (Bun.build) and re-renders on each `structuredContent` push over the bridge. `react`/`react-dom` resolve from the consumer; the core stays dependency-free.
  - **Host theming + render intent** (see `THEMING.md`). `defineMcpTool({ intent })` adds `_meta.ui.intent` (`table`/`list`/`form`/…) so a generative host (e.g. the ShipNow builder) renders `structuredContent` with its own themed component. For iframe widgets, the bridge handles a `ui/notifications/theme` push and auto-applies the host's shadcn/Tailwind semantic tokens (`--primary`, `--card`, `--border`, `--radius`, …) to the widget root — so a widget that styles with `hsl(var(--primary))` matches the embedding app with zero extra code.

  `@nifrajs/cli`'s MCP protocol core moved into `@nifrajs/mcp` (the CLI re-exports it); behavior is unchanged — a tool whose handler returns a plain `string` behaves exactly as before. nifra's own public docs MCP (nifra.dev `/mcp`) now also dogfoods this — `nifra_examples_app` renders the examples as an interactive widget.

### Patch Changes

- de9675b: Pre-1.0 security hardening pass. A framework-wide audit found no critical/high issues; these close the medium/low items it surfaced.

  - **`cache()` — no cross-user leak by default.** A `200` to a request bearing `Authorization`/`Cookie` is no longer stored (and replayed to other users) unless the response is explicitly `Cache-Control: public`/`s-maxage` (RFC 9111 §3.5). Opt back in per cache with `cacheAuthenticated: true` for a route that's identical for every caller.
  - **`idempotency()` — route-scoped keys + a `key` hook.** The default store key is now scoped by method+path, so the same `Idempotency-Key` on a different endpoint can't collide and replay another resource's response. Added a `key(req, header)` option to scope by principal (e.g. user id). Method matching normalized to upper-case.
  - **`etag()` — a `304` no longer carries the `200`'s `Content-Length`/`Content-Type`.**
  - **`@nifrajs/core` — inbound WebSocket frames are capped** when serving on Bun (`listen()`): frames over `wsMaxPayloadBytes` (default `maxBodyBytes`, 1 MB) are rejected by the runtime before reaching a handler, so a huge frame can't be buffered/parsed into memory. New `ServerOptions.wsMaxPayloadBytes`.
  - **`@nifrajs/core` — WebSocket routes are same-origin by default (CSWSH).** A `ws()` route with no `allowedOrigins` now rejects a **cross-origin browser** handshake (an `Origin` whose host differs from the request's) with `403` — closing cross-site WebSocket hijacking, since browsers send cookies on WS handshakes and don't apply CORS. Non-browser clients (no `Origin`) and same-origin browsers are unaffected. **Breaking** for a route that served a cross-origin browser without declaring `allowedOrigins`: set `allowedOrigins` to the permitted origins (or `() => true` for a genuinely public socket).
  - **`@nifrajs/node` — static file handler** now adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and re-checks the real path (symlink containment) before streaming, matching the image server.
  - **`@nifrajs/mcp` — widget bridge** now rejects `postMessage` events whose source isn't the parent window (including null-source synthetic events), closing a spoofing gap the previous guard left open.
  - **`@nifrajs/cli` — the MCP `nifra_run`/`nifra_ws` `entry` arg** is kept inside the project root, so a crafted `entry` can't import/execute a module outside the project.
