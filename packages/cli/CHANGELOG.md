# @nifrajs/cli

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- d91a45b: Remove Nifra's remaining deprecated and compatibility-only public surfaces for the 2.0 cutover.

  - `@nifrajs/core` and `nifra` now expose only the lean HTTP server API at their package roots. Import
    optional systems from their documented subpaths. The deprecated invariant runner and the
    `@nifrajs/budget` compatibility package are removed; use `@nifrajs/testing` and
    `@nifrajs/core/budget` respectively.
  - Web redirects accept only an options object as their second argument, the prerender enumeration
    wrapper is removed in favor of `enumerateStaticRoutes()`, and fragment navigation resolves IDs only.
  - MCP Apps metadata uses only `_meta.ui.resourceUri`; the deprecated flat `ui/resourceUri` key is gone.
  - Telemetry uses `ObservationAdapter` directly; the `AgentSpan`, `AgentSpanExporter`, and `SpanExporter`
    aliases are removed.
  - Invalid HTTP method overrides always fail closed with 400; the legacy ignore mode is removed.
  - `nifra build` always emits a complete target deploy directory and defaults to Bun. The old
    client-only build branch is removed; `nifra start` runs the generated Bun `server.js`.

### Minor Changes

- 6b0dbc3: Ship the executable 2.0 migration path and consolidated upgrade documentation.

  - `nifra upgrade 2.0.0` updates the fixed Nifra package group while preserving range style, moves
    the removed `@nifrajs/budget` dependency to `@nifrajs/core`, rewrites its source imports to
    `@nifrajs/core/budget`, and prints the structural cutover notes it cannot safely infer.
  - Pin rules now treat bare package names as exact matches, so upgrading `nifra` cannot rewrite an
    unrelated dependency such as `nifra-plugin`.
  - The 1.x → 2.0 guide covers opt-in runtime plugins, lean subpath imports, backend mounts, typed
    client failures, web/protocol changes, release gates, and `nifra.check.json` external mounts for
    Better Auth-style route owners.
  - External-mount matching rejects percent-encoded parent traversal as well as literal `..`, so the
    lint exception cannot hide a fetch that URL normalization moves outside its declared prefix.

- 2324d38: `nifra check` can now reach green on an app that intentionally mounts a non-typed sub-app, and raw-Response routes have an explicit opt-out.

  - **`nifra.check.json` external-mount allowlist.** A relative `fetch()` to a mounted handler that lives outside the typed contract (e.g. an auth plugin that owns `/auth/**`) was flagged as a hand-rolled own-API call - an error you could never clear. Declare those prefixes in `nifra.check.json` (`{ "externalMounts": ["/auth"] }`, segment-anchored: `/auth` blesses `/auth` and `/auth/**` but not `/authors`) and the typed-client scan skips them. The blessed prefixes are echoed on the result and printed in the report, so a suppressed mount stays auditable instead of silently hiding real drift. A malformed `nifra.check.json` is a non-fatal warning; the allowlist is simply ignored.
  - **`// nifra-expect raw-response` pragma.** A route that deliberately returns a raw `Response` (a file or redirect) raised the `response-route` advisory with no way to mark it intentional. A pragma comment on the return line, or the line above, now silences it for that route.
  - **Streaming guidance.** The `response-route` advisory now points streaming routes at the typed SSE route (`app.sse(...)`), which keeps typed events instead of collapsing the client to `data: never`.

- 5917e68: Add the `nifra_levels` MCP tool, so an agent can read the verification ladder it was already able to
  run from the CLI. It returns `{ achieved, levels[] }` across L0 typed contract, L1 route assurance,
  L2 capability lockfile, L3 route trust manifest, and L4 contract invariants, with the reasons a level
  does not hold. A project with no assurance config still answers, stopping at L0 rather than failing.
- e97a92f: `nifra sync-manifest`, plus two toolchain guards that turn opaque failures into actionable ones.

  - **`nifra sync-manifest`.** After adding/renaming/removing a page route, the committed `server-manifest.ts` drifts and `nifra check` flags it - and clearing that used to mean a full build (server + worker + migrate bundles). `nifra sync-manifest` re-scans `routes/` and rewrites just the manifest's route table in milliseconds, preserving the baked client-asset references. It does not rebuild the client bundle, so it prints a caveat: a brand-new hydrating route component still needs a full build for its client chunk. `@nifrajs/web/build` gains the pure `resyncServerManifestSource` (+ `parseManifestStyles` / `parseManifestRouteStyles`) it is built on.
  - **`nifra dev` peer preflight.** Run under `bunx @nifrajs/cli dev` (an isolated install where the project's peers do not resolve), the Vite import failed with an opaque `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. It now checks `vite` resolves from the project first and, if not, says to run the workspace-local `bun run dev`.
  - **`nifra start` build-target guard.** Pointed at a Cloudflare Pages output (a `_worker.js` bundle, no `server.js`), `nifra start` now names the mismatch and the fix (`nifra build --target bun`, or serve with `wrangler pages`) instead of a bare "no server.js".

### Patch Changes

- 7791470: `nifra check` now prints a one-line tip when the project has no `.mcp.json`, pointing at `nifra init-agents` (which wires `.mcp.json` + `.cursor/mcp.json` + a CLAUDE.md preamble, no-clobber). The tip is non-fatal and only in the human report - the `--json` path is unchanged - so a coding agent discovers the MCP wiring instead of learning the framework from sibling-app source.

## 1.13.0

### Patch Changes

- f644556: `nifra doctor` also probes the workspace root for identity-sensitive packages, so it reports the split
  where every declaring package resolves one physical copy and the root holds another. Consulting only
  the packages that declare the dependency saw a single copy and stayed quiet.

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 63d3845: Add bounded execution-causality contracts and propagation, OpenTelemetry causal links, event-envelope lineage, and a deterministic durable failure laboratory. `nifra levels` L4 now uses the deep adversarial contract engine through its explicitly isolated executor. Also add hash-verifiable adapter certification profiles and duplicate physical Nifra/React install detection in `nifra doctor`/`nifra check`.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 2dde7e5: Add the effect ledger, sandboxed contract-generated invariant tests, and the verification ladder.

  **Effect ledger** — a per-request, append-only, ordered record of side-effect intents and outcomes.
  Routes that declare `schema.capabilities` get a bounded, token-only ledger when the server enables
  `server({ effectLedger })`; each `useCapability(c, id, { target, cost, digest })` beacon
  records an intent, `recordCapabilityOutcome` records its terminal result without double-debiting
  admission, and the sink receives the sealed ledger when the response settles — on success and
  error responses alike, so partial work is audited. Entries carry capability ids, phases, adapter
  tokens, dimensionless cost counters, an optional keyed-HMAC payload digest, and bounded error codes;
  the entry type has no payload field, and the sealed ledger names the route _pattern_ plus the declared
  capability set, never the concrete URL — redaction holds by construction. Includes an optional
  tamper-evident hash chain, a bounded in-memory sink,
  and `computeEffectDigest` (keyed HMAC-SHA-256, so low-entropy data cannot be brute-forced from a
  stored digest). The hash chain binds route identity, declarations, timestamps, and entries. Sink
  failures are logged without their potentially-sensitive message and do not turn a successful effect
  into a retryable 500; transactional audit belongs in the effect's owning transaction. Routes without
  capability declarations keep the existing fast path unchanged.

  **Contract-generated invariant tests** — `runContractInvariants(app, { executor })` fuzzes each route from its
  declared JSON Schema with a deterministic seeded generator and verifies what the contract promises:
  valid inputs never crash, 2xx responses conform to the declared response schema, schema-violating
  bodies are rejected (never accepted, never a crash), and a route-level classification never
  understates its field-level tags. Findings carry the case seed for exact reproduction; ungeneratable
  routes are reported as skipped, never silently dropped.
  Dynamic execution requires an explicit `invariants.executor` backed by a disposable app/sandbox;
  verification never invokes a live app implicitly, and any skipped route prevents L4.

  **Verification ladder** — `nifra levels` computes L0 typed contract → L1 route assurance → L2
  capability lockfile → L3 route manifest → L4 invariant-tested from the existing gates. Levels are
  cumulative and computed, never self-declared; `--min <n>` gates CI on a required floor.

- 279f80c: Add a deterministic versioned Nifra manifest that joins route schemas, assurance evidence,
  capabilities, and field-level response classification in one hash-verified artifact. Manifests can be
  signed through an operator-provided Ed25519 KMS/HSM callback; Nifra never handles private keys.

  `nifra manifest emit` refuses failing assurance and writes byte-stable output, while
  `nifra manifest diff <before> <after>` hash-verifies both artifacts and fails deployment promotion on
  breaking contract, lost assurance, expanded effects, or increased data sensitivity.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 92181be: Add hardened effect and capability assurance: reflected route declarations, fail-closed runtime
  beacons, static effect-provenance analysis, deterministic capability lockfiles, HTTP safe-method
  guards, and effect-specific request or durable idempotency requirements.

  Add `nifra capabilities snapshot` and `nifra capabilities check` so capability drift and raw
  provider bypasses can be enforced in CI without adding work to the default request path.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e47c4c5: Add reflection-time route assurance: middleware and plugins can publish lifecycle-accurate enforcement
  evidence, ordered policies fail closed on unclassified/missing/forbidden evidence, official hardening
  middleware emits canonical evidence, and `nifra assure` exposes a human/JSON CI gate.
- 9433ad9: Add `nifra upgrade <version>`: an executable, per-release upgrade runner. A recipe declares the
  mechanical edits a target version needs — a dependency-pin sweep (sets every matching `@nifrajs/*`
  dependency to the target version across the workspace, preserving each spec's `^`/`~`/exact style and
  skipping `workspace:`/`link:` specs) and exact import-specifier moves — and the runner applies them
  `detect → transform → verify`, reusing the existing `nifra check` gate rather than adding a new one.
  Dry-run by default (`--write` applies, `--no-verify` skips the check, `--list` shows targets); fail-closed
  on an unknown version or a missing package.json; deterministic and idempotent. Ships the 1.8.0 recipe.
  Transforms are intentionally string/specifier-level — structural (AST) codemods are deferred until a
  recipe needs one.

## 1.7.0

### Patch Changes

- 9f23e90: Fix `nifra build --target static` producing pages that render but never hydrate. The prerender pass hardcoded a placeholder client entry, but the real bundle is content-hashed — so the prerendered HTML's hydration `<script src>` 404'd and every control was inert. `BuildTargetOptions.prerenderApp` is now a factory `(client: BuildManifest) => app` invoked with the completed client build, so the emitted `<script src>` uses the real hashed entry (plus the same styles / route-preload the SSR targets use). A regression test asserts the static HTML references the emitted hashed entry and that the file exists under `/assets`. Breaking only for code calling `buildTarget("static", …)` directly (pass a factory instead of a prebuilt app); `nifra build --target static` users just get working hydration.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 578da89: fix(cli): refresh the `nifra mcp` types/examples corpus for the 1.3.0 API + gate it

  `@nifrajs/cli` bundles the MCP corpus (`docs/types.json` / `examples.json`) behind `nifra_types` and
  `nifra_context`. It shipped **stale in 1.3.0** — the release regenerated `api-reference.md` + the LLM cards
  but not this corpus — so agents couldn't see `server().tool()` / `.resource()` / `.prompt()`,
  `onValidationError`, `RouteSchema.errors`, `ToolAnnotations`, or `generateLlmsTxt` via MCP. Regenerated.

  To prevent recurrence: `changeset:publish` now runs `gen:llms` after the build, so every published tarball
  carries a corpus regenerated from that exact build — the corpus can no longer ship stale regardless of what's
  committed.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f8d2aa: feat(cli): `nifra_check` / `nifra_test` MCP tools accept a `dir` to scope a subdirectory

  The MCP server runs at the project root, so `nifra check` / `nifra test` always ran from there — no way to
  target one app in a monorepo (a common pain: the root holds a builder + generated apps, but you want to
  check just `app/`). Both tools now take an optional `dir` (relative to the root, e.g. `"app"` or
  `"packages/api"`); the check/test runs against that subtree. Path-traversal-guarded — a `dir` that climbs
  out of the root (`../`, an absolute path elsewhere) is rejected, not run.

- 4a4b1c4: feat: `server().resource()` / `.prompt()` — app-declared MCP resources & prompts

  Completing the MCP trio alongside `.tool()`: an app can now expose its own MCP **resources**
  (`.resource(uri, { name, description?, mimeType? }, read)`) and **prompts** (`.prompt(name, { description,
arguments? }, handler)`). `nifra mcp` surfaces them in `resources/list` + `resources/read` and `prompts/list`

  - `prompts/get` (namespaced per app in a monorepo). The `read`/`handler` closures run in the app process, so
    they capture whatever app state they need — no HTTP round-trip.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 281844e: fix(cli): `nifra check` respects `.gitignore` and bounds the MCP result

  Two fixes so `nifra check` (and the `nifra_check` MCP tool) can't drown in a repo full of generated apps:

  - **Scanner honours `.gitignore`** — `walkSource` now filters candidates through one batched
    `git check-ignore`, so a gitignored generated/build tree isn't walked. A repo that gitignores, e.g., a
    238-app generated-output dir went from a **52 MB** check result to ~130 KB. Degrades to the built-in
    ignore list (node_modules/dist/…) when there's no git repo — never throws.
  - **`nifra_check` MCP tool caps its output** — `collectCheckResult` gains `maxDiagnostics` (the tool sets 100) and reports `truncated: { shown, total }`, so a huge project can't emit an MCP message large enough
    to break the stdio transport (`-32000: Connection closed`). `ok` still reflects the FULL set; the CLI
    terminal / `--json` output stays unbounded.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 5673ff1: `nifra_types` — a new MCP tool that returns the **exact TypeScript** of any exported `@nifrajs/*` symbol (interface, type, class, function, const). Each signature is generated at build time from the package's built `.d.ts` with the TS compiler — the literal declaration, complete and authoritative, never prose and never truncated — and shipped inside `@nifrajs/cli` (`docs/types.json`), so it works offline and on every transport (stdio, HTTP, the edge `/mcp`).

  This closes the gap that made agents fall back to reading `.d.ts`: when an agent needs the precise shape of a type (`RateLimitStore`, `RouteSchema`, a function signature), `nifra_types({ name })` returns the literal block. The tool description makes the completeness explicit ("the source of truth — do NOT read `.d.ts`"), and `nifra_docs` now points at it for exact types. `nifra_examples_app` on the public docs MCP, and the `@nifrajs/cli/mcp` self-host surface, both expose it too (`TypeEntry` is re-exported).

### Patch Changes

- c099d5f: Add `@nifrajs/mcp` — build MCP servers, and **MCP Apps** (interactive `ui://` widgets, SEP-1865), for a nifra app.

  MCP tools have only ever returned text. MCP Apps lets a tool return **interactive UI**: a tool links a `ui://` resource (MIME `text/html;profile=mcp-app`); the host renders it in a sandboxed iframe and bridges it to the server over MCP-JSON-RPC-on-`postMessage`. `@nifrajs/mcp` ships:

  - The transport-agnostic JSON-RPC core (`handleRpc`, shared with `@nifrajs/cli`'s dev MCP) extended for MCP Apps — `structuredContent`, `_meta.ui.resourceUri`, and the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` capability.
  - `respondMcpHttp` — a Web `fetch` handler you mount at `POST /mcp`. nifra route handlers can return a raw `Response`, so mounting is one line per verb.
  - `defineMcpWidget` — author a `ui://` widget as one self-contained HTML doc with a tiny zero-dependency `postMessage` bridge inlined (`mcpApp.onData(render)` to render the host-pushed `structuredContent`; `mcpApp.callTool(...)` to re-invoke a tool through the host).
  - `defineMcpTool` + `createMcpServer` — wire tools to widgets and get a mountable server. See `examples/mcp-app/`.
  - `@nifrajs/mcp/react` — `reactWidget({ component })` authors a widget from a React component instead of an HTML string: the component is bundled for the browser (Bun.build) and re-renders on each `structuredContent` push over the bridge. `react`/`react-dom` resolve from the consumer; the core stays dependency-free.
  - **Host theming + render intent** (see `THEMING.md`). `defineMcpTool({ intent })` adds `_meta.ui.intent` (`table`/`list`/`form`/…) so a generative host renders `structuredContent` with its own themed component. For iframe widgets, the bridge handles a `ui/notifications/theme` push and auto-applies the host's shadcn/Tailwind semantic tokens (`--primary`, `--card`, `--border`, `--radius`, …) to the widget root — so a widget that styles with `hsl(var(--primary))` matches the embedding app with zero extra code.

  `@nifrajs/cli`'s MCP protocol core moved into `@nifrajs/mcp` (the CLI re-exports it); behavior is unchanged — a tool whose handler returns a plain `string` behaves exactly as before. nifra's own public docs MCP (nifra.dev `/mcp`) now also dogfoods this — `nifra_examples_app` renders the examples as an interactive widget.

- bb31594: Surface `@nifrajs/middleware` where agents look. The `nifra_context` conventions (and a scaffolded app's `AGENTS.md`) now carry a one-line pointer: cross-cutting concerns — rate limiting (`429`), CORS, security headers, body limits, auth, CSRF, IP restriction, caching, compression — are `app.use(...)` plugins in `@nifrajs/middleware`; call `nifra_docs("middleware")` for the full list. So an agent setting up routes finds the built-in middleware (it already shipped) without having to think to search for it.
- de9675b: Pre-1.0 security hardening pass. A framework-wide audit found no critical/high issues; these close the medium/low items it surfaced.

  - **`cache()` — no cross-user leak by default.** A `200` to a request bearing `Authorization`/`Cookie` is no longer stored (and replayed to other users) unless the response is explicitly `Cache-Control: public`/`s-maxage` (RFC 9111 §3.5). Opt back in per cache with `cacheAuthenticated: true` for a route that's identical for every caller.
  - **`idempotency()` — route-scoped keys + a `key` hook.** The default store key is now scoped by method+path, so the same `Idempotency-Key` on a different endpoint can't collide and replay another resource's response. Added a `key(req, header)` option to scope by principal (e.g. user id). Method matching normalized to upper-case.
  - **`etag()` — a `304` no longer carries the `200`'s `Content-Length`/`Content-Type`.**
  - **`@nifrajs/core` — inbound WebSocket frames are capped** when serving on Bun (`listen()`): frames over `wsMaxPayloadBytes` (default `maxBodyBytes`, 1 MB) are rejected by the runtime before reaching a handler, so a huge frame can't be buffered/parsed into memory. New `ServerOptions.wsMaxPayloadBytes`.
  - **`@nifrajs/core` — WebSocket routes are same-origin by default (CSWSH).** A `ws()` route with no `allowedOrigins` now rejects a **cross-origin browser** handshake (an `Origin` whose host differs from the request's) with `403` — closing cross-site WebSocket hijacking, since browsers send cookies on WS handshakes and don't apply CORS. Non-browser clients (no `Origin`) and same-origin browsers are unaffected. **Breaking** for a route that served a cross-origin browser without declaring `allowedOrigins`: set `allowedOrigins` to the permitted origins (or `() => true` for a genuinely public socket).
  - **`@nifrajs/node` — static file handler** now adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and re-checks the real path (symlink containment) before streaming, matching the image server.
  - **`@nifrajs/mcp` — widget bridge** now rejects `postMessage` events whose source isn't the parent window (including null-source synthetic events), closing a spoofing gap the previous guard left open.
  - **`@nifrajs/cli` — the MCP `nifra_run`/`nifra_ws` `entry` arg** is kept inside the project root, so a crafted `entry` can't import/execute a module outside the project.

- a001558: **MCP warm worker survives a single per-request cancel.** The warm `nifra_run`/`nifra_render` worker is shared across concurrent calls (its `pending` map is id-keyed so several requests can be outstanding at once). Cancelling one request used to kill the whole worker process, which rejected every other in-flight request and forced a cold rebuild — defeating the warm reuse + concurrency the tool is built for. A per-request cancel now drops only that request and leaves the worker hot; it's still replaced on file change as before.
