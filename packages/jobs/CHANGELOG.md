### Minor Changes

- e8aeab9: Cache, queue and storage operations can produce capability evidence.

  ```ts
  import { useCapability } from "@nifrajs/core/capabilities";

  const cache = createCache({ beacon: useCapability });
  await cache.for(c).set(key, value); // announces `cache.write`, and fails closed if undeclared
  ```

  Static provenance answers what a MODULE can reach, so its evidence is as broad as the module holding
  it. A call answers which ROUTE did what. That is the gap these close: the token is produced by the
  operation rather than by a policy file asserting an import implies it.

  `useCapability` is passed in rather than imported, so all three packages keep their zero dependencies -
  a cache should not pull the server into a bundle that only wanted a cache. Nothing changes for existing
  code: the unbound `cache.set(...)`, `job.enqueue(...)` and `adapter.put(...)` paths are untouched, and
  `for(context)` without a configured beacon throws rather than handing back something that quietly
  produces no evidence.

  Storage takes a `withCapabilityBeacon(adapter, { beacon })` wrapper instead of an interface method,
  because `StorageAdapter` is meant to be implemented outside the package and a new method would break
  every adapter already written. `cache.wrap` announces read AND write, since a miss writes and which one
  happens is not knowable before the call.

### Minor Changes

- 56c3ee7: feat(jobs): add `@nifrajs/jobs` - typed background job queue

  Enqueue work off the request path and run it with retries, exponential backoff, and dead-lettering on a
  pluggable store (`JobStore` + an in-memory default). An in-process worker for Bun/Node/Deno with bounded
  concurrency and a graceful `stop()`; on Cloudflare Workers drive a durable store from a CF Queues
  consumer via `process()`. The async companion to `@nifrajs/cron`. Dependency-free; payloads validate at
  `enqueue` against any Standard Schema (e.g. `@nifrajs/schema`'s `t`).
