- 0ac2182: feat(core): validation failures now return **422**, plus a params-decode fast path

  **Behavior change:** a request that fails a route's `body`/`query` schema validation is now rejected
  with **`422 Unprocessable Entity`** (previously `400`). The response body shape is unchanged
  (`{ ok: false, error: "validation", issues }`). If your client branches on `status === 400` for
  validation failures, switch it to `422`. Genuinely malformed requests keep their existing codes —
  invalid JSON via `boundedJson` and an undecodable path are still `400`.

  Also: route params skip the `decodeURIComponent` pass entirely when the pathname contains no `%`
  (the overwhelmingly common case) — same behavior, less per-request work, on both the HTTP and
  WebSocket-upgrade paths.

### Minor Changes

- f1f0e18: Context ergonomics, from beta feedback building on Nifra.

  - **`c.json(body, status?)` / `c.text(body, status?)`** — build a `Response` in one line; the second arg is a status number or a full `ResponseInit`, and it works whether you `return` or `throw` it. Ideal for an auth / rate-limit short-circuit from a `derive`/`beforeHandle`: `throw c.json({ error: "unauthorized" }, 401)` instead of `new Response(JSON.stringify(…), { status: 401, headers: … })`. (In a route's happy path keep returning a plain object so the typed client stays in sync.) Added as prototype methods — no per-request allocation.
  - **One name for the request across routes and loaders.** A route handler's `c.req` is now also `c.request`, and a page loader/action's `ctx.request` is now also `ctx.req` — fixing the `c.req`-vs-`ctx.request` mismatch that was easy to trip over.

  Docs: the API page documents `c.json`/`c.text` + the request alias; a new troubleshooting entry covers a `never` typed client (raw-`Response` return, or a non-identity plugin → `defineIdentityPlugin`).

- 3efb7cd: Sharper types + names for two footguns hit building on Nifra.

  - **`defineRouterPlugin`** — a clearer-named alias of `defineIdentityPlugin` for a plugin that mounts routes/hooks but adds **no context type** (an auth router, an audit logger). `definePlugin`'s docs now loudly warn that using it for such a plugin silently collapses the typed client to `any` (no type error, no runtime error). The plugins guide leads with `defineRouterPlugin` and shows the side-effect-then-`return app` mount pattern.
  - **Better error when a route has no `query` schema.** Passing `query` to such a route via the typed client now fails with a message that reads out the fix — `add a \`query\` schema to this route — { query: z.object({ … }) } — so the typed client can accept query params here`— instead of the opaque`not assignable to type 'never'`. The error surfaces at the call site; the fix is at the route. Non-breaking: passing query to a schema-less route was already rejected, just unhelpfully.

- de9675b: Pre-1.0 security hardening pass. A framework-wide audit found no critical/high issues; these close the medium/low items it surfaced.

  - **`cache()` — no cross-user leak by default.** A `200` to a request bearing `Authorization`/`Cookie` is no longer stored (and replayed to other users) unless the response is explicitly `Cache-Control: public`/`s-maxage` (RFC 9111 §3.5). Opt back in per cache with `cacheAuthenticated: true` for a route that's identical for every caller.
  - **`idempotency()` — route-scoped keys + a `key` hook.** The default store key is now scoped by method+path, so the same `Idempotency-Key` on a different endpoint can't collide and replay another resource's response. Added a `key(req, header)` option to scope by principal (e.g. user id). Method matching normalized to upper-case.
  - **`etag()` — a `304` no longer carries the `200`'s `Content-Length`/`Content-Type`.**
  - **`@nifrajs/core` — inbound WebSocket frames are capped** when serving on Bun (`listen()`): frames over `wsMaxPayloadBytes` (default `maxBodyBytes`, 1 MB) are rejected by the runtime before reaching a handler, so a huge frame can't be buffered/parsed into memory. New `ServerOptions.wsMaxPayloadBytes`.
  - **`@nifrajs/core` — WebSocket routes are same-origin by default (CSWSH).** A `ws()` route with no `allowedOrigins` now rejects a **cross-origin browser** handshake (an `Origin` whose host differs from the request's) with `403` — closing cross-site WebSocket hijacking, since browsers send cookies on WS handshakes and don't apply CORS. Non-browser clients (no `Origin`) and same-origin browsers are unaffected. **Breaking** for a route that served a cross-origin browser without declaring `allowedOrigins`: set `allowedOrigins` to the permitted origins (or `() => true` for a genuinely public socket).
  - **`@nifrajs/node` — static file handler** now adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and re-checks the real path (symlink containment) before streaming, matching the image server.
  - **`@nifrajs/mcp` — widget bridge** now rejects `postMessage` events whose source isn't the parent window (including null-source synthetic events), closing a spoofing gap the previous guard left open.
  - **`@nifrajs/cli` — the MCP `nifra_run`/`nifra_ws` `entry` arg** is kept inside the project root, so a crafted `entry` can't import/execute a module outside the project.
